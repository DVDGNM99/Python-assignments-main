# Notes

Difference between float numbers and integer numbers.

__name__ (double underscore) is a special internal Python variable that refers to the code. __name__ == "__main__" is used when running the script directly, while replacing it with __name__ == "__filename__" allows the .py script to be used as a module so its functions can be reused in other programs I write.

Indentation error: there are code columns that contain other functions, especially with booleans. These are called blocks.

pass or ... are used in a script to complete an action that is still under development (work in progress).
