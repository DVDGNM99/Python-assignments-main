# Python Lesson 2 – Input Methods and Exercises (Weizmann Institute)

This folder contains the scripts and notes from the second Python lesson at the Weizmann Institute.  
The main topic covered in this session was how different types of input can be provided to Python programs.

## Homework Project: NeuroRender. for the complete guide check the README file inside "Homework NeuroRender"

For the homework, I developed a small program called NeuroRender, which allows the user to visualize selected brain regions from the ARA atlas.

### What is ARA?
ARA stands for Allen Reference Atlas, a standardized 3D anatomical atlas of the mouse brain developed by the Allen Institute for Brain Science.

### How it works
NeuroRender takes one or more brain region names or acronyms as input (for example, VISp, CA1, MOp) and displays a 3D rendering of the mouse brain highlighting the chosen areas.  
This visualization helps in understanding spatial relationships between different brain structures.
